# Time-Series-Prediction-Bridging-Statistical-Models-and-Deep-Learning
he fascinating intersection of traditional statistical methods and advanced deep learning techniques for accurate time series forecasting. In this project, we delve into two powerful methodologies: ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks.
