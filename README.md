# Time-Series-Prediction-Bridging-Statistical-Models-and-Deep-Learning
he fascinating intersection of traditional statistical methods and advanced deep learning techniques for accurate time series forecasting. In this project, we delve into two powerful methodologies: ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks.
Objectives
To analyze and compare the effectiveness of ARIMA and LSTM models in forecasting future values from historical time series data.
To gain insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each approach in capturing temporal patterns and trends.
Key Features
Data Exploration: The project begins with an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the underlying structure of the time series data, identifying trends, seasonality, and potential anomalies.

Model Development:

ARIMA: Implemented for its interpretability and efficiency in capturing linear relationships within the data. Hyperparameter tuning is performed to optimize performance.
LSTM: Leveraged for its ability to model complex, non-linear relationships and long-term dependencies, making it well-suited for sequences of data.
Model Evaluation: The performance of both models is assessed using various metrics, including Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), to determine their forecasting accuracy.

Visualization: Results are visualized through plots, showcasing actual vs. predicted values and highlighting the performance differences between the models.

Results
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of time series prediction, showcasing the robustness of LSTM networks in capturing complex patterns while highlighting the efficiency of ARIMA in simpler datasets. The findings contribute to a better understanding of how to leverage these techniques for various applications, including finance, sales forecasting, and inventory management.
